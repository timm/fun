[Experience suggests](/REFS#agrawal-2019) that the twin technologies
of data mining and optimization are so closely connected that 
data miners can work as
optimizers and vice versa. 
Once refactored in that way,
the new code offers many novel
design options,
some of which could even contribute to ethical goals. For example:

- It is ethical to deliver transparent and reliable code; 
- Rule learners help transparency; 
- Multi-objective optimization helps reliability.

FUN is a work-on-progress with the aim to build a reference system
that demonstrates all the above, in one succinct code base.  

Ideally, you do not like FUN. Ideally, 
you look here and says "I can do better than that", then
rushes off to refactor their own ethical code (in which case, all
the code here would become a spec for their implementation in  some
other language).
